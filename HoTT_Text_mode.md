HoTT text mode uses alphanumeric characters only to display sensor data. The module data is transfered to RC transmitter and displayed uninterpreted.

Text mode allows also to implement an "interactive" text page ie. to edit sensor preferences. It could be used to change ArduPilot PID settings remotely using your RC transmitter.
